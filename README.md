# Call For Proposals ideas

A repository for future speaker ideas and things individuals would find interesting to hear a talk about. 

Maybe you don't feel you could talk about something but would be interested in hearing someone else speak about the topic. You might want to speak but can't think of a topic.

Initially these ideas are for Umbraco events/meetups but other events are welcome such as Microsoft dotnet events/meetups. 

Just create a PR to this repo and add a topic. 

The topics and descriptions below are taken from Codegarden 2023 CFP and I felt they were good starting points.

## Technical

Your talk targets .NET devlopers and DevOps with a strong focus on code and the technical part of working with Umbraco. The talk delves into Umbraco and will give any developer an edge in the fast-moving world of the Umbraco CMS.

## Creative
