# Call For Proposals ideas

A repository for future speaker ideas and things individuals would find interesting to hear a talk about. 

Maybe you don't feel you could talk about something but would be interested in hearing someone else speak about the topic. You might want to speak but can't think of a topic.

Initially these ideas are for Umbraco events/meetups but other events are welcome such as Microsoft dotnet events/meetups. 

Just create a PR to this repo and add a topic.
